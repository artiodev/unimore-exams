 	Added	03/28/13
 	Author	Riyad Kalla
	Reason	Default Canvas 2.2+ theme has a #navigation:margin-bottom of 3em which ends up
		separating the nav bar and the body content by almost 50px. The body content
		(beginning with the H1 header) already has a top-margin that does sufficient
		spacing. This change was made to remove the 3em margin-bottom from the nav.

#navigation {
	margin-bottom: 0;

	Added	01/07/14
	Author	Riyad Kalla
	Reason	Help make code-examples stand out in the page more clearly and not blend too
		easily with the normal paragraph formatting around them; for example, on the
		container-type and value-type pages.
